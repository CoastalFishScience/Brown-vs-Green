# Brown, Green, and Everything in Between

## Abstract

Food web structure and function are dynamic, influenced by spatial and temporal factors. This study investigates the dynamics of energy pathways, specifically the fast, 'green' pathways driven by primary producers and the slow, 'brown' pathways driven by detritivores. Using Bayesian mixing models, we quantify the proportional contributions of brown and green energy pathways in functionally representative food webs across two coastal drainages. These drainages span freshwater marsh, riverine mangrove, and marine seagrass habitats, experiencing hydrologically distinct seasons.
